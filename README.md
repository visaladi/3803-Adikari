# Docker and Jenkins Setup

This repository contains code for setting up Docker and Jenkins to automate software development processes. This guide helps you set up Docker-based projects, integrate them with Jenkins for automation, and manage your development workflows.

## Overview

The setup involves the following steps:

1. **GitHub Push**: The process begins when code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
2. **Jenkins Build Trigger**: Jenkins, our automation server, is configured to monitor the GitHub repository for changes. Upon detecting a new commit, Jenkins triggers the build process.
3. **Docker Image Creation**: Jenkins pulls a base Docker image from DockerHub and builds a new Docker image containing the application and its dependencies.
4. **Docker Image Push**: Once the Docker image is built successfully, Jenkins pushes it to DockerHub, making it available for deployment.
5. **Update Status**: Jenkins updates the build status on GitHub, providing visibility into the automated process.
6. **Notification**: Users are notified of the build status through GitHub notifications.
